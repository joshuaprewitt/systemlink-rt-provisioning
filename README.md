# SystemLink RT Provisioning
This example shows how to update the firmware and then deploys a NI Linux RT System Image, so that the target is ready to be added to SystemLink.

The example is configured to work with a cRIO-9068, but you can update the firmware file path to use it with other controllers.

In addition, you may need to update the image ID and version to match the version on your host, which you can find if you open `C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\RT Images\PXI System Image\<version>\linux-rt-rss.cdf` with a text editor.
